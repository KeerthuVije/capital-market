Supplementary Requirements

1. Automate this entire setup, so anyone can provision/destroy the setup using a single click of a button
    I.You can use a suitable AWS or any cloud/virtual service or any other suitable tool/template to
      automate infrastructure provisioning/destruction.
    II.You can use any configuration management tool (such as Puppet, Chef or Ansible) to bootstrap the
       server.
       A. Didn't use any configuration management tools per se but have used a S3 config bucket along with Bash Scripts (Userdata) to be automated fully.

2. Business requirement is to make the website available 9*5. Do the required to support this business requirement
   without any manual intervention of Application Support team.
   A. Added a Scheduled Scale Down policy under ASG
   
3. Ensure availability and reliability of this setup
    A. Use an ASG, Launch Config with fully automated userdata scripts and Load Balancer to run health checks every 5 mins, incase any instance fails
       the health check, it will be kicked out and replaced by a new instance
    B. Tested all scripts vigorously to make sure its reliable
    C. In order to make sure availability under load, added an ASG and divided traffic using a Load Balancer 
	
4. Ensure the solution is cost effective.
    A. Used cheaper DynamoDB to store monitoring statuses
    B. Used Spot Instances to reduce cost
    C. Used Scheduled Scale Down when not needed to reduce cost
    D. Used small instances 
	
5. Solution you suggest should be secure.
    A. Used Encrypted S3 buckets to store Keys
    B. Used Proper Security Group rules.
    C. Access to SSH port is very limited using a Security Group
    D. Created IAM roles for the instances, giving permission to the only required resources and actions
	
6. Containerize the solution
	A. Didn't do this part
